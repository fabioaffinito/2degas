1. why ntype doesnt work as shared?
2. Subroutine flow

3. reptation.f90/subroutine restart
Why doesnt this fail for nproc > 8*mproc ? (mproc=16)
           integer seed_tot(8*mproc)
           do i=1,nproc
              read(8,*)(seed_tot(j),j=8*(i-1)+1,8*(i-1)+8) ! why doesnt this fail for nproc>8*16 ?
           enddo
In fact with -check it gives an error. On DEEP it doesnt compile
(may have to make seed_tot allocatable)
