1. why ntype doesnt work as shared?
2. Subroutine flow
- input
- sonaseppia
	sigma
	vmc
end

3. reptation.f90/subroutine restart
Why doesnt this fail for nproc > 8*mproc ? (mproc=16)
           integer seed_tot(8*mproc)
           do i=1,nproc
              read(8,*)(seed_tot(j),j=8*(i-1)+1,8*(i-1)+8) ! why doesnt this fail for nproc>8*16 ?
           enddo
In fact with -check it gives an error. On DEEP it doesnt compile
(may have to make seed_tot allocatable)

4. check SAVE variables, esp in two_body. For OMP these are shared by default. 
5. floating point exception in slater excitations, reptation 5436. Problem with p_new

6. REstart from second thread is wrong. Look at line 458. Properties are wrong
7. Restart files should be written with OMP CRITICAL. Now crashes only after 10 steps.
