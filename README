1. why ntype doesnt work as shared?
2. Subroutine flow
- input
- sonaseppia
	sigma
	vmc
end

3. reptation.f90/subroutine restart
Why doesnt this fail for nproc > 8*mproc ? (mproc=16)
           integer seed_tot(8*mproc)
           do i=1,nproc
              read(8,*)(seed_tot(j),j=8*(i-1)+1,8*(i-1)+8) ! why doesnt this fail for nproc>8*16 ?
           enddo
In fact with -check it gives an error. On DEEP it doesnt compile
(may have to make seed_tot allocatable)

4. check SAVE variables, esp in two_body. For OMP these are shared by default. 
5. floating point exception in slater excitations, reptation 5436. Problem with p_new

6. REstart from second thread is wrong. Look at line 458. Properties are wrong
7. Restart files should be written with OMP CRITICAL. Now crashes only after 10 steps.
Note that this will slow the program down alot for many threads. Reconsider this bit.
(MCDRAM of KNL?). Also perhaps omp_set_lock?
8. OMP Critical inserted in read_conf. still crashes. omp barrier inserted just before main loop. program now seems to work.
9. Consider adding threadprivate for all SAVE variables
